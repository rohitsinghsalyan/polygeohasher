# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for reorganizing the polygeohasher Python package to improve code structure, API consistency, testing, and maintainability. The current codebase has inconsistent API design, scattered functionality, and unclear module organization that needs to be addressed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the polygeohasher package, I want a consistent and intuitive API, so that I can easily understand and use all the package functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing polygeohasher THEN the package SHALL provide both functional and class-based APIs consistently
2. WHEN using the functional API THEN all core functions SHALL be directly accessible from the main module
3. WHEN using the class-based API THEN the Polygeohasher class SHALL provide all functionality as methods
4. WHEN calling any API function THEN the function signatures SHALL be consistent and well-documented

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the polygeohasher package, I want clear separation of concerns in the module structure, so that the codebase is easier to maintain and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the package structure THEN core functionality SHALL be separated into logical modules
2. WHEN looking at the main module THEN it SHALL only contain high-level API functions and imports
3. WHEN examining utility functions THEN they SHALL be organized in appropriate submodules
4. WHEN importing from submodules THEN the imports SHALL follow Python best practices

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to the polygeohasher package, I want comprehensive and well-organized tests, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN all test functions SHALL have unique names
2. WHEN examining test files THEN tests SHALL be organized by functionality
3. WHEN running the test suite THEN all core functionality SHALL be covered
4. WHEN adding new features THEN the test structure SHALL support easy addition of new tests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user reading the documentation, I want the README examples to match the actual API, so that I can successfully use the package without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the README THEN the usage examples SHALL match the actual API
2. WHEN following the README examples THEN they SHALL work without modification
3. WHEN examining the API documentation THEN it SHALL be consistent with the implementation
4. WHEN using either functional or class-based API THEN both approaches SHALL be documented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want the package to follow Python packaging best practices, so that it integrates well with my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing the package THEN the __init__.py file SHALL properly expose the public API
2. WHEN examining the package structure THEN it SHALL follow standard Python package conventions
3. WHEN using the package THEN private implementation details SHALL not be exposed in the public API
4. WHEN installing the package THEN all dependencies SHALL be properly declared
